# ðŸ“š Git Tutorial: Upload a Local ROS (or Any) Package to GitHub

This repository contains a step-by-step guide for taking a **local package** (even from `Downloads/`) and uploading it to GitHub.  
It also includes tips for handling **LF â†” CRLF line ending warnings** on Windows.

---

## ðŸ›  1. Create a Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)  
2. Click **+** (top right) â†’ **New repository**  
3. Fill in:
   - **Repository name** â†’ choose a name (e.g., `my_ros_package`)
   - Visibility â†’ Public or Private  
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README (avoid conflicts)
4. Click **Create repository**  
5. Copy the repository URL (e.g. `https://github.com/your-username/my_ros_package.git`)

---

## ðŸ’» 2. Initialize Git in Your Local Package
Navigate to your package folder (example if stored in Downloads):
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/my_ros_package
````

Initialize git and create a `main` branch:

```bash
git init
git branch -M main
```

---

## ðŸ”— 3. Add the Remote Repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my_ros_package.git
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ 4. Add & Commit Your Files

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of my package"
```

---

## ðŸš€ 5. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

âœ… Done! Your package is now on GitHub.

---

## âš  Handling LF â†” CRLF Warnings (Windows Users)

If you see warnings like:

```
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
```

This means your files use Linux-style **LF** endings, but Windows prefers **CRLF**.
For cross-platform projects (ROS, Gazebo, Linux servers), **keep LF endings**:

```bash
git config core.autocrlf input
```

Or make it global (applies to all repos):

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

### Optional: Enforce LF in the Repo

Create a `.gitattributes` file in the root of your project:

```gitattributes
* text=auto eol=lf
```

Commit and push it:

```bash
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add gitattributes to enforce LF endings"
git push
```

---

## ðŸ”„ Updating the Repository Later

Whenever you make changes locally:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
git push
```

---

## âœ… Summary

This workflow lets you:

* Upload local projects (ROS packages, Python scripts, etc.) to GitHub.
* Avoid common CRLF/LF pitfalls when working on Windows.
* Keep your repository in sync with local changes.

---

ðŸ“Œ **Tip:** If you plan to collaborate with others, always use `git pull` before you start working to get the latest updates from GitHub:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

```

---

You can create a new GitHub repo (e.g., `upload-local-package-guide`), put this `README.md` inside, and push it.  
This way, youâ€™ll have a **public reference** you can share with teammates or reuse later.

---

Want me to add a **ready-to-use `.gitattributes` file** (so you can include it in the same repo as an example)? That would make it fully copy-paste friendly for others.
